"""Package the browser extension into store-ready zips.

Produces, in the project root:
  - magic_downloader_chrome.zip    (Chrome / Edge / Brave / Opera; MV3 service worker)
  - magic_downloader_firefox.zip   (Firefox AMO; event-page scripts + gecko settings)

Each zip has manifest.json at its root (as the stores require), assembled from
manifests/manifest.base.json plus that browser's overlay — so neither store ever
sees the other browser's background format. This mirrors build.js, which writes
the same merged manifest into browser_extension/ for "Load unpacked".

Single source of truth: manifests/. There are no per-browser manifest files
inside browser_extension/ any more (that's what made Chrome choke on Firefox's
`background.scripts`).

Usage:  python build_extension.py
